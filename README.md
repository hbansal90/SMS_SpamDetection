# SMS Spam Detection Project

## Overview

This data science project focuses on the detection of SMS spam using machine learning techniques. The goal is to build a predictive model that can accurately classify SMS messages as either spam or non-spam (ham). The project utilizes Machine Learning classification algorithms to achieve this objective.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project contains a collection of SMS messages labeled as spam or ham. It is sourced from [https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/228/sms+spam+collection]. The dataset is preprocessed to clean and prepare the text data for analysis.

## Project Structure

The project is organized as follows:

- **Data Exploration**: Initial exploration of the dataset to understand its structure and characteristics.
- **Data Visualisation**: To gather more insights into the data exploration and analysis, we have put on variious data visual techniques.
- **Data Preprocessing**: Text cleaning and feature engineering to prepare the data for model training.
- **Model Development**: Building and training machine learning models, including the use of machine learning classification algorithm.
- **Evaluation**: Assessing the performance of the models using relevant metrics.

## Usage

To run the project locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/sms-spam-detection.git
